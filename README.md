# Pixel-Perfect
This site was the first project that I ever attempted in terms of programming.
Basically the goal was to make the html for a screenshot of an already built webpage 
without using any of the actual source code.
I was able to make it look ... similar at best. I wasn't expecting a lot for my first project
but this was extremely difficult for me and tested my patiencce.
In the end it didn't look perfect and it wasn't dynamic at all (Only worked on very set screen
size). But I learned a lot about how block elements worked and how to style them.
